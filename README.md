## MedPajama: A Large-scale Trustworthy Medical Corpus

MedPajama is an ambitious initiative to build one of the largest, most reliable, and clinically credible medical corpora to support the development of next-generation medical AI systems. In a domain where accuracy, interpretability, and trust are paramount, high-quality data is the foundation.

## âš¡ Introduction
This project focuses on constructing a trustworthy medical dataset by:
1. Collecting and filtering massive-scale pretraining data from authoritative sources.
2. Annotating data with multi-level labels (e.g., medical domain, semantic type, source credibility).
3. Extracting the highest quality and most reliable data to build a RAG knowledge base.
4. Selecting high-confidence and challenging questions to construct datasets for SFT and RL.

Whether you're developing medical foundation models, disease-specific LLMs, or medical RAG systems, MedPajama provides a trusted data backbone to support your research and applications.
